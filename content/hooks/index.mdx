A collection of modern, server-safe React hooks, most of them are inspired by [usehooks](https://github.com/uidotdev/usehooks), [useHooks-ts](https://github.com/juliencrn/usehooks-ts) and [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use).
If you want to add your own hook (with credits), please [open a pull request](https://github.com/mehdibha/rcopy/pulls).
