## Introduction

2024 was the year of the copy and paste revolution. [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
has popularized the idea of shipping components as plain code that can be copied and pasted into your own projects.

This has led to a new wave of developers sharing their own components as plain code that can be copied and pasted into your own projects.

rCopy wants to extend this idea to all the React ecosystem such as hooks, blocks, icons and more. In the future, we want even to extend to complete features (front-end and api)

> "Dependency Minimalism: Why go through all of this work to delete dependencies? After having a blog for 10 years, I've gained a new appreciation for keeping things simple. Now, I'm not going full minimalist here. I still want nice things. But I'm taking more opportunities to simplify and keep more code managed in the repo."

## FAQ

**What is rCopy?**

rCopy is a collection of components, hooks, blocks, icons and more that you can copy and paste to build your own React applications.

**What’s the difference between rCopy and other React libraries?**

Whilst most react libraries are packages, rCopy is not. Instead our elements are available in plain code and can be copied from our website. This allows full customization and reflects the new wave of shipping components.
In other words, sometimes copy and paste can be better than using the wrong abstraction obtained from a react library.

**What’s the difference between rCopy and shadcn?**

For core components, there's a minimal difference ([changelog](http://rcopy/docs/changelog#april-2024---product-launch)). However, rCopy extends the idea of copy and paste to all the React ecosystem such as hooks, blocks, icons and more.

**What are the advantages of copy and paste?**

- **Customization**: You can easily customize the code to fit your needs.
- **Dependency minimalism**: You don’t need to install any dependencies.
- **Ownership**: You own the code and can modify it as you wish.
